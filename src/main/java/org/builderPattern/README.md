Builder Pattern Implementation: BurgerMealThis repository contains a Java implementation of the Builder Design Pattern, using a BurgerMeal example to demonstrate how to construct complex objects step-by-step.📌 OverviewThe Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step-by-step. Unlike other creational patterns, the Builder pattern does not require the product to have a common interface. This makes it possible to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.Why use it?Avoids "Telescoping Constructors": No more giant constructors with 10+ parameters where you can't remember which String is which.Immutability: The BurgerMeal fields are final, ensuring that once a meal is built, it cannot be altered.Readability: The "Fluent API" style (withCheese(), withSide()) makes the code self-documenting.💻 Implementation DetailThe implementation uses a Static Inner Class (BurgerBuilder) to handle the construction logic.1. Mandatory vs. Optional ParametersIn this example:Mandatory: bun and patty (passed via the Builder constructor).Optional: hasCheese and side (set via setter-like methods).2. The Code structureJava// Usage Example
BurgerMeal meal = new BurgerMeal.BurgerBuilder("Brioche", "Beef")
                    .withCheese(true)
                    .withSide("Fries")
                    .build();
🛠 How it WorksPrivate Constructor: The BurgerMeal constructor is private, meaning it can only be instantiated through the BurgerBuilder.Chaining: Each method in the builder (e.g., withSide) returns this (the builder instance itself), allowing for method chaining.The Build Step: The .build() method calls the private constructor of BurgerMeal, passing the current builder instance to populate the final object.🚀 Advantages in this ProjectFeatureBenefitEncapsulationConstruction logic is isolated from the main class.ControlYou can enforce validation before the build() method is called.FlexibilityYou can create different variations of a BurgerMeal without multiplying constructors.
